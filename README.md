I initially created my [personal website](https://katium.co.za) using basic HTML & CSS. The repo to my old website is available [here](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/website).
This project was created as my means to Learn how to work with React.JS .

My interests span a lot of fields & I'm more than just my Resume & Skills, hence the new website doesn't include seeing or downloading my CV.
I also took out the contact page to avoid a lot of spam messages from both hackers(black hats) & robots/AI. 
I intend to rebuild this project again in the near/far future so to have a concise reusable structure.
